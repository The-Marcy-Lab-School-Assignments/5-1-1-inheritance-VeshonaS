# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
An instance method is a specific type of the class using the `new` keyword for example:
```js
const myCar = new Car(arg1, arg2) 
```
A class method will call the class a whole, for example :
```js
Car(arg1, arg2)
```

Super close, you are correct that we first need to create an instance to use an instance method. With a class method we do not need to create an instance! We can just invoke it on the class itself. Take this as an example: 

```js
class Pet {
  static allPets = []
  constructor(name,type){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
    Pet.allPets.push(this)
  }
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
  static getAllPets(){
    return [...Pet.allPets];
  }
}

const cat = new Pet("Mia", "Cat")
cat.speak() // this is an instance method and is used after we created our instance

Pet.getAllPets() // this is a class method and we do not need an instance to invoke it!
