# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
An instance method is a specific type of the class using the `new` keyword for example:
```js
const myCar = new Car(arg1, arg2) 
```
A class method will call the class a whole, for example :
```js
Car(arg1, arg2)
```
