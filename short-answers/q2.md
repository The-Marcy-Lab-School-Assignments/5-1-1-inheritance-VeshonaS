# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name 
    this.zoo = []
  }
  addAnimal(animal){
    this.zoo.push(animal)
    return `You added a ${animal} to the zoo!`
  }
}
class Reptile extends Animal {
  constructor(name, kind ){
    super(name)
   this.kind = kind  
  }
  /** FEEDBACK: This should be outside of the Reptile class! */ 
  const lizard = new Reptile('Lizard', 'Iguana')
} 

```

# Teacher Feedback

You showed inheritance really well! Good job however you are missing the second part of this question which asks: In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.
