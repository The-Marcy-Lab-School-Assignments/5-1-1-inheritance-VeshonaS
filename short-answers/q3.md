# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is the changing and adding of methods and properties from a parent class, for example:
```js
class Person {
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name 
  }
}
class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, company ){
    super(name)
    this.company = company 
    
  }
  explain(){
    console.log(`${name} works for ${company}`)
  }

}
class Janitor extends Employee {
  constructor(name, company, role ){
    super(name, company )
      this.role = role 
  }
  explain(){
    console.log(`${name} is a ${role} for ${company}`)
  }
}
const worker = new Employee('jane', 'Target')
worker.explain() // jane works for Target 

const cleaner = new Janitor('jane', 'Target', 'janitor')
cleaner.explain() // jane is a janitor for Target
```

Polymorphism has more to do with the methods. You are correct however in that are directly correlated to inheritance! You show this in your example with the different children classes. 

Polymorphism is seen when there are 2 classes that are related(parent & child) and they each have the same method name but the method's implementation is different! Check out this example: 

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
  }
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
    super(name,type)
  }

  speak(){
    console.log("I am a dog");
  }
}
const cat = new Pet("Mia", "Cat")
cat.speak() // logs 'the pet speaks'

const doggo = new Dog("Charlie", "Big")
doggo.speak() // logs 'I am a dog'
```
