# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is the changing and adding of methods and properties from a parent class, for example:
```js
class Person {
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name 
  }
}
class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, company ){
    super(name)
    this.company = company 
  }
}
class Janitor extends Employee {
  constructor(name, company, role ){
    super(name, company ){
      this.role = role 
    }
  }
}
```
