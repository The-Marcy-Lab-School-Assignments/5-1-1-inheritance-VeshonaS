# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is the changing and adding of methods and properties from a parent class, for example:
```js
class Person {
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name 
  }
}
class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, company ){
    super(name)
    this.company = company 
    
  }
  explain(){
    console.log(`${name} works for ${company}`)
  }

}
class Janitor extends Employee {
  constructor(name, company, role ){
    super(name, company )
      this.role = role 
  }
  explain(){
    console.log(`${name} is a ${role} for ${company}`)
  }
}
const worker = new Employee('jane', 'Target')
worker.explain() // jane works for Target 

const cleaner = new Janitor('jane', 'Target', 'janitor')
cleaner.explain() // jane is a janitor for Target
```
